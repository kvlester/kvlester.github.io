	<h2> EXOPLANET HOST BINARIES FROM K2 & TESS </h2>
	<p>
	For my postdoc project, I am studying how host star binarity affects planet formation and survival. 
	As part of the speckle group at Ames, I help conduct follow-up high resolution imaging of planet candidate host stars 
	found by TESS using the Alopeke & Zorro speckle cameras at Gemini N & S. 
	We found that binaries that host planets have larger separations than field binaries. 
	We also found an observational bias against detecting small (<2 Re) transiting planets, 
	because they are hidden in the glare of the binary stars.

	<p> I also started a long term monitoring campaign of close binary stars found to host exoplanets by Kepler, K2, & TESS. 
	We measure the relative astrometric positions of each binary using speckle interferometry at Gemini, as well as 
	the stellar radial velocities with WIYN/NEID and APF/Levy. 
	Our goal is to measure the binary orbit of each system to determine what binary configurations are amenable to planet formation.

		<h2>Visual Orbits of Spectroscopic Binaries </h2>
		<p>
		For my PhD project, I determined the visual and spectroscopic orbits for 8
		double-lined spectroscopic binaries by combining echelle spectroscopy from 
		the <a href="http://www.apo.nmsu.edu"> APO 3.5m</a> and 
		<a href="http://www.ctio.noao.edu/noao/content/chiron"> CTIO 1.5m</a> 
		with long baseline interferometry from the 
		<a href="http://www.chara.gsu.edu">CHARA Array</a>. </p>
		<p> The fundamental parameters of eclipsing binary stars are used to test stellar
		evolutionary models by comparing the observed and predicted stellar parameters, such
		as mass, radius and temperature. However, most eclipsing binaries have short orbital
		periods, which implies that the stars probably interacted in their early phases and are
		currently subject to tidal forces. So, it is not clear how applicable the parameters of
		close binaries are to evolutionary models of single stars. The solution to this problem
		is to expand binary star studies to longer period systems that are widely separated and
		not interacting. This requires the measurement of a visual orbit to estimate the
		orbital inclination, which is then combined with the spectroscopic elements to find
		masses.

	<h2>A Photometric, Spectroscopic and Apsidal Motion Analysis of BW Aqr</h2>
	<p> <span class="image right"><img src="rvlc.png" /></span>   
	Eclipsing binary systems showing apsidal motion can be used to test the internal structure 
	predictions of stellar evolution models. For this purpose, 
	we present a photometric and spectroscopic analysis of the eclipsing binary BW Aquarii, an evolved 
	F-type binary with slow apsidal motion. We model the K2 C3 light curve using the Eclipsing Light 
	Curve code to determine several orbital and stellar parameters, as well as measure the eclipse times 
	to determine updated apsidal motion parameters for the system. Furthermore, we obtain high-resolution
	spectra of BW Aqr using the CHIRON echelle spectrograph on the CTIO 1.5m for radial velocity analysis. 
	We then reconstruct the spectra of each component using Doppler tomography in order to determine the 
	atmospheric parameters. We find that both components of BW Aqr are late F-type stars with M1 = 
	1.365 +/- 0.008 Msun, M2 = 1.483 +/- 0.009 Msun, and R1 = 1.782 +/- 0.021 Rsun, R2 = 2.053 +/- 0.020 
	Rsun. We then compare these results to the predictions of several stellar evolution models, finding 
	that the models cannot reproduce the observed properties of both components at the same age.

	<h2> K2 C0 Eclipsing Binary near EPIC 202062176		</h2>
	<p><span class="image right"><img src="ELC-LC.png" /></span>
	We completed a photometric and light curve analysis of an eccentric eclipsing		
	binary in the K2 Campaign 0 feld that resides in Sh 2-252E, a 
	young star cluster embedded in an H II region. Because there dozens of stars in this embedded 
	cluster fall within the Kepler aperture, we obtained spectra of the three brightest stars in the 
	crowded aperture to identify which is the binary system. We found that none of these stars are 
	components of the eclipsing binary system, which must 
	be one of the fainter nearby stars. However, these bright cluster members
	all have remarkable spectra: Sh 2-252a (EPIC 202062176) is a B0.5 V star with
	razor sharp absorption lines, Sh 2-252b is a Herbig A0 star with disk-like emission
	lines, and Sh 2-252c is a pre-main sequence star with very red color.
