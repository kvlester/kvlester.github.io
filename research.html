	<h2> EXOPLANET HOST BINARIES FROM KEPLER & TESS </h2>
	<p>
	My postdoc at NASA Ames focuses on understanding how host star multiplicity affect planet formation and survival. 
		We are interested in what binary separations, orbital eccentricities, and mutual inclinations allow planets to form.
		As part of the speckle group at Ames, I help observe exoplanet host stars with the `Alopeke and Zorro speckle cameras 
		on the Gemini 8m telescopes for the TESS Follow-up Working Group. 
	</p>
	<p>
	My first postdoc project involved collecting all of these observations and determining the orbital separations for exoplanet 
		host stars found to be binaries. We showed that the lack of close companions to exoplanet hosts stars found by past 
		studies is not an observational bias -- exoplanet host binaries have larger separations than field binaries (see figure below), 
		likely because a close companion would disrupt the protoplanetary disk and prevent planets from forming. 
		We also found that TESS cannot detect small, transiting planets in binary systems due to the dilution from the companion. 
		In the righthand figure below, we show the planet radii vs period for single v.s. binary TESS hosts and the clear 
		observational bias against detecting small (&lt;2Re) planets in binary systems.  (Read more at&nbsp;

	The second goal of my postdoc project is to measure the visual and spectroscopic orbits of binary stars found to host planets by 
		Kepler, K2, and TESS. We began a monitoring campaign to measure the relative binary positions from speckle interferometry 
		using the Alopeke and Zorro on Gemini N & S 8m telescopes, and the binary radial velocities using echelle spectra from 
		NEID on the WIYN 3.5m and APF on the Lick 2m telescopes.

		<h2>Visual Orbits of Spectroscopic Binaries </h2>
		<p>
		For my PhD project, I determined the visual and spectroscopic orbits for 8
		double-lined spectroscopic binaries by combining echelle spectroscopy from 
		the <a href="http://www.apo.nmsu.edu"> APO 3.5m</a> and 
		<a href="http://www.ctio.noao.edu/noao/content/chiron"> CTIO 1.5m</a> 
		with long baseline interferometry from the 
		<a href="http://www.chara.gsu.edu">CHARA Array</a>. </p>
		<p> The fundamental parameters of eclipsing binary stars are used to test stellar
		evolutionary models by comparing the observed and predicted stellar parameters, such
		as mass, radius and temperature. However, most eclipsing binaries have short orbital
		periods, which implies that the stars probably interacted in their early phases and are
		currently subject to tidal forces. So, it is not clear how applicable the parameters of
		close binaries are to evolutionary models of single stars. The solution to this problem
		is to expand binary star studies to longer period systems that are widely separated and
		not interacting. This requires the measurement of a visual orbit to estimate the
		orbital inclination, which is then combined with the spectroscopic elements to find
		masses.

	<h2>A Photometric, Spectroscopic and Apsidal Motion Analysis of BW Aqr</h2>
	<p> <span class="image right"><img src="rvlc.png" /></span>   
	Eclipsing binary systems showing apsidal motion can be used to test the internal structure 
	predictions of stellar evolution models. For this purpose, 
	we present a photometric and spectroscopic analysis of the eclipsing binary BW Aquarii, an evolved 
	F-type binary with slow apsidal motion. We model the K2 C3 light curve using the Eclipsing Light 
	Curve code to determine several orbital and stellar parameters, as well as measure the eclipse times 
	to determine updated apsidal motion parameters for the system. Furthermore, we obtain high-resolution
	spectra of BW Aqr using the CHIRON echelle spectrograph on the CTIO 1.5m for radial velocity analysis. 
	We then reconstruct the spectra of each component using Doppler tomography in order to determine the 
	atmospheric parameters. We find that both components of BW Aqr are late F-type stars with M1 = 
	1.365 +/- 0.008 Msun, M2 = 1.483 +/- 0.009 Msun, and R1 = 1.782 +/- 0.021 Rsun, R2 = 2.053 +/- 0.020 
	Rsun. We then compare these results to the predictions of several stellar evolution models, finding 
	that the models cannot reproduce the observed properties of both components at the same age.

	<h2> K2 C0 Eclipsing Binary near EPIC 202062176		</h2>
	<p><span class="image right"><img src="ELC-LC.png" /></span>
	We completed a photometric and light curve analysis of an eccentric eclipsing		
	binary in the K2 Campaign 0 feld that resides in Sh 2-252E, a 
	young star cluster embedded in an H II region. Because there dozens of stars in this embedded 
	cluster fall within the Kepler aperture, we obtained spectra of the three brightest stars in the 
	crowded aperture to identify which is the binary system. We found that none of these stars are 
	components of the eclipsing binary system, which must 
	be one of the fainter nearby stars. However, these bright cluster members
	all have remarkable spectra: Sh 2-252a (EPIC 202062176) is a B0.5 V star with
	razor sharp absorption lines, Sh 2-252b is a Herbig A0 star with disk-like emission
	lines, and Sh 2-252c is a pre-main sequence star with very red color.
