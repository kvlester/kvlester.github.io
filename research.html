<h2>Visual Orbits of Spectroscopic Binaries </h2>
<p>
For my PhD project, we determined the visual and spectroscopic orbits for 8
double-lined spectroscopic binaries by combining echelle spectroscopy from 
the <a href="http://www.apo.nmsu.edu"> APO 3.5m</a> and 
<a href="http://www.ctio.noao.edu/noao/content/chiron"> CTIO 1.5m</a> 
with long baseline interferometry from the 
<a href="http://www.chara.gsu.edu">CHARA Array</a>. 
The fundamental parameters of eclipsing binary stars are used to test stellar
evolutionary models by comparing the observed and predicted stellar parameters, such
as mass, radius and temperature. However, most eclipsing binaries have short orbital
periods, which implies that the stars probably interacted in their early phases and are
currently subject to tidal forces. So, it is not clear how applicable the parameters of
close binaries are to evolutionary models of single stars. The solution to this problem
is to expand binary star studies to longer period systems that are widely separated and
not interacting. This requires the measurement of a visual orbit to estimate the
orbital inclination, which is then combined with the spectroscopic elements to find
masses.

<h2>A Photometric, Spectroscopic and Apsidal Motion Analysis of BW Aqr</h2>
<p> <span class="image right"><img src="rvlc.png" /></span>   
Eclipsing binary systems showing apsidal motion can be used to test the internal structure 
predictions of stellar evolution models. For this purpose, 
we present a photometric and spectroscopic analysis of the eclipsing binary BW Aquarii, an evolved 
F-type binary with slow apsidal motion. We model the K2 C3 light curve using the Eclipsing Light 
Curve code to determine several orbital and stellar parameters, as well as measure the eclipse times 
to determine updated apsidal motion parameters for the system. Furthermore, we obtain high-resolution
spectra of BW Aqr using the CHIRON echelle spectrograph on the CTIO 1.5m for radial velocity analysis. 
We then reconstruct the spectra of each component using Doppler tomography in order to determine the 
atmospheric parameters. We find that both components of BW Aqr are late F-type stars with M1 = 
1.365 +/- 0.008 Msun, M2 = 1.483 +/- 0.009 Msun, and R1 = 1.782 +/- 0.021 Rsun, R2 = 2.053 +/- 0.020 
Rsun. We then compare these results to the predictions of several stellar evolution models, finding 
that the models cannot reproduce the observed properties of both components at the same age.

<h2> K2 C0 Eclipsing Binary near EPIC 202062176		</h2>
<p><span class="image right"><img src="ELC-LC.png" /></span>
We completed a photometric and light curve analysis of an eccentric eclipsing		
binary in the K2 Campaign 0 feld that resides in Sh 2-252E, a 
young star cluster embedded in an H II region. Because there dozens of stars in this embedded 
cluster fall within the Kepler aperture, we obtained spectra of the three brightest stars in the 
crowded aperture to identify which is the binary system. We found that none of these stars are 
components of the eclipsing binary system, which must 
be one of the fainter nearby stars. However, these bright cluster members
all have remarkable spectra: Sh 2-252a (EPIC 202062176) is a B0.5 V star with
razor sharp absorption lines, Sh 2-252b is a Herbig A0 star with disk-like emission
lines, and Sh 2-252c is a pre-main sequence star with very red color.
